# How to Run the Word Ladder Game

This guide will walk you through compiling and running the **Word Ladder Game** locally on your machine.

---

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 17 or later installed  
- All required game files (`.java`, `.png`, `.wav`, `.txt`) in place  

---

## Directory Structure (Expected)

```
Final Project/
├── src/                  # All your .java source files
│   └── ...
├── out/                  
├── WordLadder.jar        
├── README.md
├── howtorun.md
└── .gitignore
└── stddraw.jar
└── *.png             # Background images
└── *.wav             # Sound effects
└── word_ladder_words.txt

```

## ✅ Step 1: Download `stdlib.jar`

If you don't already have it, download the official `stdlib.jar` file:

> 📥 [Click here to download](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/stdlib.jar)

Once downloaded, **place it in the root directory** of your project (same level as your `src/` and `assets/` folders).

---

## Compile the Game (If using source files)

Run this command **from the root project folder**:

```bash
javac -d out -cp "stdlib.jar:src" src/*.java
```

This compiles all `.java` files inside `src/` and places `.class` files into the `out/` directory.

---

## ▶️ Run the Game

If you already have the `WordLadderGame.jar` file, simply run:

```bash
java -cp "out:stdlib.jar" Game
```

**Windows Users:** Use a semicolon instead of a colon:
```
java -cp "out;stdlib.jar" Game
```

---

## 🧩 Notes

- Make sure the `assets/` folder is in the same directory as your `.jar` or project root when running. The code loads files like `background.png`, `victory.wav`, and `word_ladder_words.txt` at runtime.
- If using IntelliJ or another IDE, make sure the working directory is set to the project root.
- If you encounter a sound or file-not-found error, double-check file paths and ensure case-sensitivity matches (especially on macOS/Linux).

Enjoy the game!
